### What
This game was made in 48 hours for GMTK Game Jam 2018.  
Code, drawings and sound effects were all made during this period. 

A real time strategy game, where you can't control units.   
Instead you can place down resources, and your workers will collect and use them.

### How to play
Press H to start and pause the game.

Place down bushes for your workers to collect food and spawn a new worker, wood to produce new buildings and iron to create soldiers. Soldiers and Workers appear near the building that spawned them, and buildings appear near a resource stash that is close to the building that has the wood.

You need fervour (lightning symbol) to place down resources.

The enemy has the same powers as you! You win if all enemy buildings are destroyed, and lose if all your buildings are destroyed.

### Tools
The game was made using Processing 3.0.   
Sounds were recorded in house using a mic.  
All the graphics are hand drawn and scanned.
